Many of us were taught that the Gospel is the “plan of salvation” — a formula to get to heaven.

But what if the Gospel is something greater?

The book “The Gospel of King Jesus” challenges us to expand that vision.

The “Plan of Salvation” is individual and focused on the forgiveness of sins to secure heaven — it’s a solution to a personal problem.

The “Gospel,” however, is the grand story of a King (Jesus) who is establishing His Kingdom on Earth.
It’s not just about where we go after we die, but about how we live now — as loyal disciples of a King.

The Gospel includes the plan of salvation, but it’s much more than that.
It’s an invitation to be part of the Kingdom of Jesus.

The Gospel is more than individual salvation!

For those who think the Gospel is just a “plan of salvation,” that view is incomplete.
It teaches us about forgiveness, but not about loyalty to a King.
The Gospel is the story of a King — Jesus — who invites us to live under His authority as part of His Kingdom, here and now.
