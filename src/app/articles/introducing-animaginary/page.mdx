I have noticed something that bothers me a lot. Behind the glamorized narrative of success, where great entrepreneurs brag about working 16 hours a day and sleeping only 4 hours a night, there is a dangerous trap.

Recently, I watched (or tried to watch) a video in which a successful entrepreneur said his biggest regret in life was not seeing his daughter grow up. That hit me hard. I realized that, no matter how much society values exhaustion as a sign of ambition, the price you pay for this mentality can be far too high.

Money buys many things, but it doesn’t buy lost time, shaken mental health, or being present in important moments.
I truly believe it’s possible to achieve success without sacrificing personal life and well-being. We don’t need to burn ourselves out to be someone!

We can work, fulfill our hours, and when the day is done, truly disconnect. Taking care of family, mind, and body isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.

True success, to me, is balance. It’s having time to live the life we work so hard to build. The greatest asset we can have is our health and our relationships, so we never regret that time passed and we didn’t even notice.
